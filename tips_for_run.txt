Tips for run.sh:
run.sh with no parameters will run the program with default 16 processes
It also accept parameters will a number which can be 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ...
The number refers to the process number to run the program.
Others numbers will lead to unexpected errors.

Examples:

./run.sh
./run.sh 4
./run.sh 32

Some known problems:
When I run my program, I found it might stall sometimes.
The cause is strange. I think it may be the problem of some hosts.
They lost some messages for  unknown reasons.
So if you find the program stalled in one run, please kill it and run it
again.
